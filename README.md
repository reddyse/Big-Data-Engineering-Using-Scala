## NETFLIX RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

## Objective:

The objective of this project was to build a collaborative movie recommendation system using Scala for users using the Netflix Movie Dataset.

## Scala Programming:

- Kafka Producers and Consumers
- Play
- Spark
- Spark MLib

## Actors:

- User : The user wil be asked to rate Top 10 movies.
- The System : With the help of the previous data and the user rating for Top 10 movies, post application of Machine Learning algorithm top 10 movies will be recommended by the system for that user

## Conclusion:

The project makes used of machine learning algorithm to build movie recommendation systems. We have developed a model with 97% accuracy.
